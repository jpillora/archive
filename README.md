# archive

**Archive** combines Go's `archive`/[`zip`](http://golang.org/pkg/archive/zip) & [`tar`](https://golang.org/pkg/archive/tar) into a simpler, higher-level API

[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/jpillora/archive?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/jpillora/archive)

### Features

* Simple
* Supports `tar`, `tar.gz` and `zip`
* Great for streaming directories over the network (e.g. see [serve(1)](https://github.com/jpillora/serve))

### Quick Usage

``` go
package main

import (
	"os"

	"github.com/jpillora/archive"
)

func main() {
	a := archive.NewTarGzWriter(os.Stdout)
	a.AddBytes("foo.txt", []byte("hello foo!"))
	a.AddBytes("dir/bar.txt", []byte("hello bar!"))
	a.Close()
}
```

``` sh
$ go run example.go | tar zxvf -
x foo.txt
x dir/bar.txt
```

See the [example/](example/) for more

#### Todo

* Add extraction support
* Add `.7z` archive type
* Add `.lz` compression type
